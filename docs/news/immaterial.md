##### Immaterial

I stand here, something about your door mat, or is it me? It has been a while, and I have thought hard about this - getting here. I had it all figured out, or maybe I thought that I had figured it out. Either way, I am here. The potted flowers look lovely, you have always had that in you - a bring-out-all-the-beauty aura. 

The morning breeze is crisp, almost frosty, my fingertips gray. He looks at me, I look at me, from the glass on the door, taking me back. I gaze down, past the glass reflection, at the shimmering wood, brown of coffee beans. The image fades away on the wood, dull of morning, the sun is not out yet. This is taking too long. A gaze up at the doorbell, such a small object, yet my fate it held tight. She was on the other side, a world away, yet not so far away. A shiver. Every possible thought, of what could be. Have you ever been here? Standing, thinking, dreading every bit of it. Man up and get along with it, but it is not that simple, is it? Goosebumps, but not from the cold, deep breath. 

The doorbell echoes through the morning chill, did I press too hard? Too long? Tension building, someone definitely heard that. Step back.

Every second is dreadful, when doom looms by the passing of each. The silver lining suddenly is not there, the glitter of the morning dew suddenly faded, the world loses all colour. 

Creak! 

The coffee smells divine. And yet, it is not the coffee that I want the most. I'm thinking, when I should be saying something. 

Eyes on me, those deep caramel oceans. An attempted smile, she understands. That short stare, more than what words would embody is 'said'. 

The cold is now biting harder, it seems. The eastern horizon is brighter though, maybe there is hope, for this day.For me?! Loud sigh! 

Out of my lucid bewilderment, she nods me in. Remember that symphony? That engulfing blend? Xmas all over again!
