##### History.
Tiktok was not always Tiktok, in fact Tiktok was birthed out of ambition. Back in `2016`, Chinese tech giant ByteDance released an app called `Douyin` as a video-sharing social platform. 


`ByteDance` is a Chinese technology company that `develops social media and news platforms`. It was `founded in 2012` by Zhang Yiming, Liang Rubo and a team of others. ByteDance is best known for its video-sharing apps TikTok and Douyin, with Tiktok taking on the global stage. ByteDance employs the `use` of a technology we have so far got accustomed to, `Artificial Intelligence` or AI. Through AI, content and services are personalised for each user based how they interact with the platforms owned by ByteDance. 


So, back to Douyin. Douyin is full on China-based, requiring up to a Chinese phone number to register. Back in the day (2016), Douyin became really popular in China and Thailand. So, ByteDance had a thought and decided to `go international`, under the name, you guessed it, `Tiktok` - this is in  `2017`. However, Tiktok was not available globally, yet. In comes `Musical.ly` - the reason Tiktok is global today. `Musical.ly` was another Chinese social media platform launched back in 2014. Musical.ly, simply put, allowed users to create and share short videos with emphasis on the music aspect. Back then, Musical.ly had what ByteDAnce needed the most -  a large user base. `ByteDance acquired Musical.ly` in 2017 and in 2018, they `merged Tiktok with Musical.ly`, unleashing a global phenomenon that has millions of users per day today.


"TikTokâ€™s secret lies in its use of music and an extraordinarily powerful algorithm, which learns what content users like to see far faster than many other apps." - Bing AI.
