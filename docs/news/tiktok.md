#### Yes! This is about Tiktok!

Another article? Discussing the same Tiktok? Well, yes! But stick around, hear me out!

##### History.
Tiktok was not always Tiktok, in fact Tiktok was birthed out of ambition. Back in `2016`, Chinese tech giant ByteDance released an app called `Douyin` as a video-sharing social platform. 


`ByteDance` is a Chinese technology company that `develops social media and news platforms`. It was `founded in 2012` by Zhang Yiming, Liang Rubo and a team of others. ByteDance is best known for its video-sharing apps TikTok and Douyin, with Tiktok taking on the global stage. ByteDance employs the `use` of a technology we have so far got accustomed to, `Artificial Intelligence` or AI. Through AI, content and services are personalised for each user based how they interact with the platforms owned by ByteDance. 


So, back to Douyin. Douyin is full on China-based, requiring up to a Chinese phone number to register. Back in the day (2016), Douyin became really popular in China and Thailand. So, ByteDance had a thought and decided to `go international`, under the name, you guessed it, `Tiktok` - this is in  `2017`. However, Tiktok was not available globally, yet. In comes `Musical.ly` - the reason Tiktok is global today. `Musical.ly` was another Chinese social media platform launched back in 2014. Musical.ly, simply put, allowed users to create and share short videos with emphasis on the music aspect. Back then, Musical.ly had what ByteDAnce needed the most -  a large user base. `ByteDance acquired Musical.ly` in 2017 and in 2018, they `merged Tiktok with Musical.ly`, unleashing a global phenomenon that has millions of users per day today.


"TikTok’s secret lies in its use of music and an extraordinarily powerful algorithm, which learns what content users like to see far faster than many other apps." - Bing AI.

##### Great history, but what's up with the fuss surrounding tiktok?

- **Tiktok has been plagued with privacy issues and data breaches.** The Tiktok app grants several permissions by default and will proceed to repeatedly ask you to grant it a permission if you had denied it. [The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/jul/19/tiktok-has-been-accused-of-aggressive-data-harvesting-is-your-information-at-risk) describes Tiktok's measures as `aggressive`. Tiktok may access data such as your calendars, contact lists, media and files including those on external storage, device location. Here is the catch though, the app does not necessarily need all that data to function. So where does all this data go? Why does the app need all that data? Read more on that article from The Guardian.

- **Tiktop has been accused of moderating content and being racialy biased** by censoring or removing content that is critical to the Chinese government and discriminating against certain users by limiting their exposure on the app.
  
- **Tiktok allows content that promotes violence, abuse and/or illegal activities** to exist and be shared on the platform without restriction. Tiktok also does not protect minors from unsafe content, according to reports.

- **TikTok has been accused of being a breeding ground for cyberbullying.** This is due in part to the app's anonymous commenting feature, which makes it easy for users to harass and bully others without fear of being identified.


So, what's my take? Probably never going to ever board the tiktok train. I understand that Tiktok has remodelled the internet and brought about a new way to be more creative and engaging in this digital world, however, the allegations against Tiktok are not to be taken lightly. It is sad how some of us may question what they have to hide by basing their argument on the fact that they do not belong to a certain group of people or that they do not meet a certain standard. It is not about what you have to hide, rather, it is a matter of considering your online safety and safety of the person next to you. The more of you there is out there, the more you are prone to cyber attacks, as attackers have the luxury of piecing together the abundant information they have of you. Remember Bytedance which owns Tiktok? Well, ByteDance is owned by the Chinese government. The Chinese government also has access to this data and you do not know who may be monitoring you.

Why are kids on tiktok? Stuff is all over, gnarly and haunting videos get shared randomly and we're just letting kids joy ride on tiktok.
