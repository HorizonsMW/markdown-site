># Yet here we are;

Flip a coin, the anticipation building, as you watch it hit its peak. The unending fall, neurons firing on all, what's it going to be... Meanwhile a breeze stirs the pines on the front, beams of the setting sun peak through, with a sprinkle of scarlet - how can such beauty exist in all these chaos.

Sometimes everything feels like that fall, just a second before the landing; when its all resonating in your head, and every outcome has a chance for a grand entrance. Those scarlet beams hit the conner of your eye ever so slightly, a glance at the scorching giant. There are days I have thought about all the sides of the coin, sitting here staring at the evening sky, why did it have to be two really?! 
>Hey little brown Kitty, easy, it will be ok.

Remember that tingle, of a cold soda, rolling down your tongue? The sizzling. Such pleasures Kitty, gone just as soon as you'd started to relish the moment. Now the bottle's empty. What does a man have to do to have one more second of the sizzling? Ok, this bottle was great. 

See, I never liked cats, but you I like. We talk. I feel like I am assuring myself that it will be ok, maybe I am, but I want it to be ok for you too. 

Snuggle back into your corner Kitty, its not a stormy night tonight, but wild nights are coming. Before that coin lands we'll have to decide. So much to worry about now, why don't they tell us this? Do they? Let's go back inside Kitty, the darkness is setting in. 
>**You know what, lets always find time, to come back, and enjoy a little purr; just a few words - that mean much more - you mean much more.**
