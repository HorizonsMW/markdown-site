What the heck? Where are we? Is this what absolute void feels like? 
## Titan
##### The first of the colonies. 
New dawn. Green horizon. The winds are at an astonishing speed of 100 miles an hour. Unbearable. Seven tries to keep his balance, stretching out his arm to hold on a nearby branch. Snap. He stumbles back into a rigid chest. He looks up, dark void eyes and a gruesome grin of drool and fangs stares back at him. For a minute there he loses his breath, face pale, like frost bite, eyes void of the energy to blink. Oh God! No! Cough. The winds blinding, he tries to find his feet, like a toddler ran over by a pup, the ground is all soggy, then he finally does. Growl. He turns back wiping his face, this is the second time he’d tripped off his feet. It’s getting to him, the fright, of being swept off the ground.

##### Silver Bell
Two meters above the ground, fur so thick he barely felt any temperature change, Silver Bell always had Seven’s back. This is his third week out here, the wild north. Extreme and unforgiving. Yet here he was, a lone soldier; or so we thought. 

A Man with a dream, or in a dream? It’s all hazy, like winds out here; frosty, fast, blurry. Not for Silver Bell though. This was his home; he was accustomed to all this and went by without even minding a tiny bit. He felt every bit, the slightest tingle, the fiery brush of the frost, all of it. And he never questioned it. Not Seven, every bit of being out here was fiery, everything shook him; from the mild breathing of the birds, the sing song of the crickets, to the growl of a distant beast. This wasn’t his place; he knew that too well. And yet he pushed on, like a man on a mission, to a fate he had no clue about. Suicidal? They questioned him, to which he never paid attention. He knew he had to get it done, no one else would. He believed that each of us had a part to play in fate, and that this was his. 
Back road is to road, back rail to rail? Never mind, ‘cause here it was. Clean and shimmery by the morning sun. surely something had passed through. Tracks still warm.

##### A new day
A new day, one not to dwell in the past, yet here he was. A prisoner of the past, cast out to fight by a past he detested. Yet, this was the only way, or so he thought. Nevertheless, a lot was at stake. The sun had to rise again for generations. And so did the moons, hence the circus; of navigating in the harsh north – the unruly north.
He focused his eyes, as far out as he could see, in the chaos of the morning. Not much hope for his worn-out eyes, time was catching up with him. Two ways to go; to the south – green fields of hopelessness, a dying civilization; to the north – a frenzy of the extremes of the elements. He knew his path, yet there he stood, pondering. This was going to do a number on him. 
The first stride, up, to the north, it was Silver Bell’s turn to hesitate. He felt it, the wild world north of north, at the world’s end. He could take it though, but he loath the idea – the world’s end was literally just that; an icy pit of spirits, a dark arctic – void of life.
Silver Bell looked up into the horizon, a low growl – here goes. Loyalty tramped all reasoning for him, a pup to a mother, or rather to a Seven – for what it’s worth. He looked down on the tiny fragile pile of cells, Seven glared up, ‘What!!?’ Whine. ‘I know…’ It was a huge pill to swallow. 
The two matched on, not enjoying the scenery at all. That’s not say it wasn’t stunning, hold your breath, it was stunning up here. From high up top, on the icy rocks, the wild north flaunted its beauty – pun intended. A sheer mastery of nature’s architecture, breathless. Flawless glaciers, on a lucky day, could be seen as far as the eye could see. All these, perfect cornrows of ice cutting across the wide fields with the occasional bump of a mountain, yet no pleasure in savoring any of it. Such was the north. Punishing. A gem planted in the chaos of the cosmos.
