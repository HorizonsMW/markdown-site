# What is this site all about?
### Hello, thank you for being here.
***
This site is a demo used to learn markdown. I have always looked at markdown with a rather curious face. I started working with markdown a few years back, but then I did not know what I can really do with it except write project documentations. Markdown started having an impact on me when I learned that it can be used to make some "**colourful**" readme's. My first markdown documenation was literally just a text file, I mean it had nothing "**colourful**" in it. I later learned of tools that can make great readme's. I was so amazed. I went on and put my all into it, and boy was I in for a ride. I'll just link it [here](https://github.com/HorizonsMW/HorizonsMW.github.io/blob/main/README.md).

So after that, fancy readme's kind of became a thing for me, I'd just see them everywhere. The turning point, when I decided I was going to learn markdown, was when [Chris Titus](https://christitus.com/) showcased his site that he built with markdown. I was amazed - poof! It was fast and the web pages were flawless, so I thought, "Why not try it..." And, well, here we are.

I'll keep on learning markdown, thanks to a book I found [online](https://www.markdownguide.org/book) by Matt Cone. 

Publishing this site has been made possible and deployed using [Netlify](https://app.netlify.com/) which I also saw, for the first time, in one of Chris Titus's videos on Youtube.

All the `code` is housed in this **[directory](https://github.com/HorizonsMW/docusaurus-base/tree/main/my-website)** on Github.
